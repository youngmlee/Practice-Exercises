Write a method sum (sum_array in python, SumArray in C#) that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers.

Examples

You cannot assume the size of the array.
You can assume that you do get an array and if the array is empty, return 0. */

Provide output in this format: For dates in the future: "You are ... year(s) old." For dates in the past: "You will be born in ... year(s)." If the year of birth equals the year requested return: "You were born this very year!"

"..." are to be replaced by the number, followed and proceeded by a single space. Mind that you need to account for both "year" and "years", depending on the result.
